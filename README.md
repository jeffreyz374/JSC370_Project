This is the GitHub repository for my JSC370 final project. In this project, I analyzed data on the goals scored by National Hockey League (NHL) players Alexander Ovechkin and Wayne Gretzky, both of whom are considered to be the greatest goal scorers in NHL history, to try to get an idea of which of these goal scoring talents impacts their teams' odds of success on a greater scale.

For this project, I wrote a PDF report summarizing my data scraping and cleaning techniques, my model building methods, and my results and conclusions, and I also created a website to host this report and a suite of interactive visuals that are derived from the data that I scraped and cleaned. All the files that are needed to compile the website are in the master branch of this repository while the report is located in the main branch.

The website is located at: https://jeffreyz374.github.io/Ovi-Gretzky-Comparison-Project/index.html
