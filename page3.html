<p>These are additional interactive visuals that are derived from the
information on all of the goals ever scored by Ovechkin and Gretzky.
Although not relevant to the scope of the project, these visuals still
provide a comparison between the individual goal scoring talents of both
players.</p>
<p>Note that as Ovechkin is currently an active player in the NHL and
the 2023-24 NHL Regular Season is currently ongoing, any data
corresponding to him is accurate as of the last update to this website.
This update was most recently performed on March 8th 2024.</p>
